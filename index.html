        Asriel Miku Rostadottir is a Goliath Ice Dragon Mage, and this is her
        fanpage by her biggest fan and player, yours truly. I hope you become as
        obsessed with her as I am.

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Born Asriel Annette Rapture Rostadottir, she gained her middle name Miku
      from her family of dragons. While there isn't much information on what her
      life was like before the age of 10, she was found by an ice dragon named
      Fir who, with the help of other dragons, not only saved her life but
      helped her thrive on the mountain.
