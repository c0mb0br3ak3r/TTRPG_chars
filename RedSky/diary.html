      <h3>About the attack boost potion...</h3>
      <p>
        While we were on the boat to Beltry, Asriel was presented with three
        ingredients (I do not remember what they are) and made a mysterious
        potion that promised an attack boost. As of right now, I'm not quite
        sure that the DM remembers this. I am not going to tell him either.
